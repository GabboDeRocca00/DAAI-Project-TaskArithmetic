# DAAI Project Repository

This repository contains all the necessary files to reproduce the results presented in the project report.

## Contents

- **DAAI Project V11.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the bulk of the code and is intended to be used on Google Colab.
- **DAAI Project Folder Structure**: This folder includes subfolders, and the structure used to carry out the project.

## How to Use These Files

1. **Download and Unzip**: Download the entire repository and unzip the files.
2. **Create Data Folder**: Manually create a folder named `data` inside the `DAAI Project Folder Structure`.
3. **Download and Unpack Dataset**: Download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BiK9sYyTslcxQQoS3vZGF02hRg6OQpR4) and unpack it into the `data` folder.
4. **Upload to Google Colab**: Upload the file `DAAI Project V11.ipynb` to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
5. **Run Jupyter Notebook**: Execute the file `Run Jupyter Notebook - windows.bat` located in the `DAAI Project Folder Structure` folder. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClTWPoDHY_s) to install it.
6. **Copy URL**: When the command prompt opens, copy the line under "Or copy and paste one of these URLs:".
7. **Connect to Local Runtime**: In Google Colab, click on "Connect to a local runtime" (found under the arrow next to "Connect" at the top right of your screen) and paste the copied URL.
8. **Run Preliminary Steps**: Execute all sections under "00 - Preliminary Steps".
9. **Run Other Sections**: You can run any other section of the code. While the sections are not entirely independent, running all sections under the same number should work.
